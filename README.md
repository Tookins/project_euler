This is a go module containing solutions to project euler problems in the go programming language.
The solutions are intended to work relatively efficiently on any properly formatted input, and to use
good go programming practices. Because this is also the way I am learning go, occasionally problems
are solved in a roundabout way in order to play around with language features.
